A demo app to validate your MDI installation
and illustrate how a fully operational app is configured
and used.

This demo app is deliberately simple to show the 
basic concepts of step modules and how to get 
a table, text block, and an image onto the user's web page.

Additional standard elements enable code viewers and 
the R console in appropriate usage modes.
